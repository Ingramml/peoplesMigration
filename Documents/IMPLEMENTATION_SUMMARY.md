---

## Changes Implemented

### ✅ 1. Added Centered Title

- [ ] Layer control works (toggle layers on/off)
- [ ] Legend displays in bottom-right
- [ ] Click district boundary → popup shows Registrations/Residents counts
- [ ] Click blue marker → popup shows "Living Location"
- [ ] Click green marker → popup shows "Registration Location"
- [ ] Click line → popup shows "Movement Connection"
- [ ] Representative links open in new tab

## Known Issues

### None identified yet

Potential issues to watch for:
1. If district has no registrations/residents, popup will show "0"
2. If representative info missing, shows "Representative information not available"
3. Loading overlay requires JavaScript - no fallback for disabled JS

---

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

These were in the plan but skipped per user request:

### Skipped (Phase 5.1):
- ❌ Meta description
- ❌ Open Graph tags
- ❌ Twitter cards
- ❌ Schema.org markup
- ❌ Extended SEO optimization

### Not Yet Implemented:
- Search functionality (find districts by number)
- Export data to CSV
- Print-friendly view
- Dark mode toggle
- Heat map visualization
- Historical data comparison
- Gzip compression (.htaccess file)
- Service worker for offline access
- Analytics integration

---

## Performance Notes

### File Sizes:
- `index.html`: ~53KB (was ~47KB, increased due to inline CSS)
- `js/app.js`: ~3KB (new file)
- `data/Fixedgeometries_1.js`: 328KB (unchanged - largest file)

### Load Time Optimization Opportunities:
1. **Enable gzip compression** on web server (would reduce sizes by 60-80%)
2. **Convert inline styles to external CSS file** for caching
3. **Lazy load non-critical layers** (load on demand)
4. **Simplify district geometries** (reduce coordinate precision)
5. **Convert data to GeoJSON files** (load via AJAX)

## How to Use the Map

### For End Users:

1. **View Statistics:**
   - Click any district boundary to see Registration vs Resident counts
   - Click blue dots to see Living Locations
   - Click green dots to see Registration Locations

2. **Toggle Layers:**
   - Use layer control (top right) to show/hide layers
   - Helpful for focusing on specific data

3. **Measure Distances:**
   - Click ruler icon (top left)
   - Click map to measure distances

4. **Navigate:**
   - Drag to pan
   - Scroll to zoom
   - Click +/- buttons to zoom

### For Developers:

1. **Backup Location:**
   - Original file saved as `index.html.backup`

2. **Data Updates:**
   - Update `data/Lineayer_regloc_4.js` for new registration data
   - Update `data/Lineayer_Living_3.js` for new resident data
   - Counts will automatically recalculate on page load

3. **Styling Changes:**
   - Modify inline `<style>` block in `index.html` (lines 17-298)
   - Or extract to external CSS file for better maintainability

4. **Function Modifications:**
   - Edit `js/app.js` for counting logic changes
   - Edit popup functions in `index.html` for display changes
