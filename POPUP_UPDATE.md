# Popup Update Summary

**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Update:** Improved district popup display and clarity

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Labels
**Before:**
- "Registrations"
- "Residents Registered"

**After:**
- "Registration Points" (clearer terminology)
- "Living Location Points" (clearer terminology)

### 2. Added Total Count
**New field:**
- **Total Points:** Sum of registration + living location points
- Helps users quickly see total activity in a district

### 3. Replaced "Difference" with "Population Movement"
**Old display:**
- Difference: 12 (100%)

**New display shows one of:**
- **Net Inflow: +30** (green highlight - more registrations than residents)
- **Net Outflow: -12** (red highlight - more residents than registrations)
- **Balanced** (blue highlight - equal numbers)
- **No Data** (gray highlight - no points in district)

### 4. Added Color-Coded Visual Indicators

**Inflow (Green):**
- Background: Light green (#e8f5e9)
- Border: Green (#4caf50)
- Meaning: More registration points than living location points

**Outflow (Red):**
- Background: Light red (#ffebee)
- Border: Red (#f44336)
- Meaning: More living location points than registration points

**Balanced (Blue):**
- Background: Light blue (#e3f2fd)
- Border: Blue (#2196f3)
- Meaning: Equal number of both point types

**No Data (Gray):**
- Background: Light gray (#f5f5f5)
- Border: Gray (#9e9e9e)
- Meaning: No points in this district

## Interpretation Guide

### Understanding the Data

**Registration Points (Green Markers):**
- Where people are registered for activities
- All 30 points are currently in District 1

**Living Location Points (Blue Markers):**
- Where people actually live
- Distributed across Districts 2-8 (30 total points)

### What the Movement Means

**Net Inflow (+):**
- District attracts people from other areas
- More activity registration than residential presence
- Example: District 1 (+30) - all registrations, no residents

**Net Outflow (-):**
- District residents go elsewhere for activities
- More residential presence than activity registration
- Example: District 2 (-12) - 12 residents, 0 registrations

**Balanced:**
- Equal distribution of registration and living points
- Activity and residence are aligned
- Currently no districts show this pattern

**No Data:**
- No data points in this district
- Neither registration nor living location points
- Currently no districts show this pattern

---

## Visual Design

### Color Scheme
- **Green** = Positive inflow (more coming in)
- **Red** = Negative outflow (more going out)
- **Blue** = Balanced (neutral)
- **Gray** = No data available

### Typography
- Clear, readable labels
- Bold values for emphasis
- Consistent spacing and hierarchy

---

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `index.html` (popup function and CSS)

### CSS Classes Added
```css
.stat-row.inflow    /* Green background with green left border */
.stat-row.outflow   /* Red background with red left border */
.stat-row.balanced  /* Blue background with blue left border */
.stat-row.no-data   /* Gray background with gray left border */
```

### JavaScript Logic
```javascript
// Calculate movement direction
if (registrations > residents) {
    netMovement = 'Net Inflow: +' + (registrations - residents);
    movementClass = 'inflow';
} else if (residents > registrations) {
    netMovement = 'Net Outflow: -' + (residents - registrations);
    movementClass = 'outflow';
} else if (total > 0) {
    netMovement = 'Balanced';
    movementClass = 'balanced';
} else {
    netMovement = 'No Data';
    movementClass = 'no-data';
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. Clarity
- Labels clearly state "points" to avoid confusion
- "Population Movement" is more descriptive than "Difference"

### 2. Visual Hierarchy
- Color coding helps users quickly identify patterns
- Green/red immediately communicates direction

### 3. Context
- Total count provides additional context
- Net movement shows magnitude and direction

### 4. Professional Appearance
- Clean, modern design
- Consistent with data visualization best practices

## User Testing Recommendations

1. **Click District 1** - Should show green "Net Inflow: +30"
2. **Click District 2** - Should show red "Net Outflow: -12"
3. **Click District 3-8** - Should show red outflow with varying numbers
4. **Verify colors** - Green for inflow, red for outflow
5. **Check totals** - Should sum registration + living points

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Percentage Display**

2. **Historical Comparison**
   - Compare current vs previous time periods
   - Show trend arrows (â†‘â†“)

3. **Interactive Filtering**

   - Filter by movement type (inflow/outflow)

4. **Export Data**
   - Download district statistics as CSV
   - Generate printable reports

5. **Tooltips**
   - Hover over labels for detailed explanations
